#Atomic Words

---
###Goals:
The goal is to create a program that accepts words as input and then outputs all the possible ways, if any,
to form the words using only atomic symbols (e.g. Hg, As) and then maybe to allow some way for it to save
the word as an image file where the atomic symbols are in boxes with their number, mass and full name.

* Readme

* Enter info about elements
* Works
* Allow element data to be loaded from file
* Add better error handling for parsing XML files
* Decent logging in general

####Short Term Plans:
* Create command to export a word as an image file where each atomic symbol is in a box like the ones on the periodic table of elements
* Command to give more info about the atomic symbol spelling(s) of a word (in case someone hasn't memorized their atomic symbols)

####Long Term Plans:
* GUI
